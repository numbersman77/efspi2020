# Introduction

This short document summarizes the feedback provided by attendees of the 4th EFSPI regulatory statistics workshop in Basel 23/24th September 2019. The first few paragraphs are a curated summary of the free text fields, followed by a display of the raw data. For curation, I extracted the two main themes from every free text field (so the total frequency in curated tables can be up to $2 \cdot `r max(nr)` = `r 2 * max(nr)`$).

# Management summary

* Median rating was `r median(quality, na.rm = TRUE)`/10.
* Most liked:
  * Presence of regulators.
  * Relevance of topics.
  * Panel discussions.
* Most disliked:
  * RWD sessions, the were perceived to lack focus (also feedback from personal communications).
  * The location is maybe less liked than we think, especially the chairs!
  * Quality of talks: not adjusted for time, busy slides, two presenters for one talk, ...
* Topics for 2020:
  * Estimands (in the barchart, more estimand entries with comments are also found with lower frequencies).
  * Safety.
  * Involvement of HTA.

Please also have a look at the very last bullet point: "Comments (raw data)". These, I did not curate. Some key comments:

* Better prepare panel discussions.
* Share questions of Session 6 with panel before, and have them prepare better.
* Gender distribution (chairs, speakers).

# Curated summary 

## Response

We had `r max(nr)` attendees complete the feedback questionnaire.

## Overall rating

Questionnaire question: _How do you rate the overall quality of the workshop (0 = useless, 10 = world class)?_

```{r, echo = FALSE, results = 'asis', message = FALSE}
t1 <- t(as.data.frame(addmargins(table(quality))))
rownames(t1) <- c("rating", "frequency")
pander(t1)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "", fig.align = "center", fig.width = 7, fig.height = 3}
par(mfrow = c(1, 1), las = 1)
plot(0, 0, xlim = c(0, 10), ylim = c(0.75, 1.25), yaxt = "n", xlab = "quality score (0 - 10)", ylab = "")
boxplot(quality, horizontal = TRUE, add = TRUE)
```

The median rating was `r median(quality, na.rm = TRUE)`.

## What did you like most about this workshop (curated)?

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "", fig.align = "center", fig.width = 7, fig.height = 6}
t2 <- table(c(like1[, 1], like2[, 1]))
t2 <- t(as.matrix(t2[rev(order(t2))]))
par(las = 2, mar = c(12, 4.5, 3, 1))
barplot(t2, ylab = "frequency", main = "most liked, curated")
```

## What did you dislike most about this workshop (curated)?

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "", fig.align = "center", fig.width = 7, fig.height = 6}
t2 <- table(c(dislike1[, 1], dislike2[, 1]))
t2 <- t(as.matrix(t2[rev(order(t2))]))
par(las = 2, mar = c(15, 4.5, 3, 1))
barplot(t2, ylab = "frequency", main = "most disliked, curated")
```

## Quality of session themes?

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "", fig.align = "center", fig.width = 7, fig.height = 5}
par(las = 1)
barplot(table(themes), main = "Quality of session themes", ylab = "frequency")
```

## Quality of talks?

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "", fig.align = "center", fig.width = 7, fig.height = 5}
par(las = 1)
barplot(table(talks), main = "Quality of talks", ylab = "frequency")
```

## Quality of location?

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "", fig.align = "center", fig.width = 7, fig.height = 5}
par(las = 1)
barplot(table(location), main = "Quality of location", ylab = "frequency")
```

# Topics for 2020

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "", fig.align = "center", fig.width = 7, fig.height = 6}
t2 <- table(c(topics20_curated1[, 1], topics20_curated2[, 1], topics20_curated3[, 1]))
t2 <- t(as.matrix(t2[rev(order(t2, rev(names(t2))))]))
par(las = 2, mar = c(15, 4.5, 3, 1))
barplot(t2, ylab = "frequency", main = "Topics for 2020 (sorted by frequency, then alphabetically)")
```
