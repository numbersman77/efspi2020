# Introduction

This short document summarizes the feedback provided by attendees of the 5th EFSPI regulatory statistics workshop in Basel 12/13th October 2020. 

## Response

We had `r nrow(feedback)` attendees complete the feedback questionnaire. The difference in responses in the tables below refers to "Did not attend".

## Overall rating

Questionnaire question: _How do you rate the overall quality of the iDMC webinar (0 = useless, 5 = world class)?_

```{r, echo = FALSE, results = 'asis', message = FALSE}
t1 <- t(as.data.frame(addmargins(table(like1))))
rownames(t1) <- c("rating", "frequency")
pander(t1)
```

The median rating was `r median(like1, na.rm = TRUE)`.

Questionnaire question: _How do you rate the overall quality of the estimand webinar (0 = useless, 5 = world class)?_

```{r, echo = FALSE, results = 'asis', message = FALSE}
t1 <- t(as.data.frame(addmargins(table(like2))))
rownames(t1) <- c("rating", "frequency")
pander(t1)
```

The median rating was `r median(like2, na.rm = TRUE)`.

## Most important topic for next year?

```{r, echo = FALSE, results = 'asis', message = FALSE}
t1 <- as.data.frame(topic1[is.na(topic1) == FALSE])
names(t1) <- "Most important"
pander(t1)
```

## 2nd most important topic for next year?

```{r, echo = FALSE, results = 'asis', message = FALSE}
t1 <- as.data.frame(topic2[is.na(topic2) == FALSE])
names(t1) <- "2nd most important"
pander(t1)
```
