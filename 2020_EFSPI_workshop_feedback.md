# Introduction

This short document summarizes the feedback provided by attendees of the 5th EFSPI regulatory statistics workshop in Basel 12/13th October 2020. 

## Response

We had 37 attendees complete the feedback questionnaire. The difference in responses in the tables below refers to "Did not attend".
