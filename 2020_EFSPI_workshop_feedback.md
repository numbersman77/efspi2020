# Introduction

This short document summarizes the feedback provided by attendees of the 4th EFSPI regulatory statistics workshop in Basel 23/24th September 2019. The first few paragraphs are a curated summary of the free text fields, followed by a display of the raw data. For curation, I extracted the two main themes from every free text field (so the total frequency in curated tables can be up to $2 \cdot 49 = 98$).

# Management summary

* Median rating was 8/10.
* Most liked:
  * Presence of regulators.
  * Relevance of topics.
  * Panel discussions.
* Most disliked:
  * RWD sessions, the were perceived to lack focus (also feedback from personal communications).
  * The location is maybe less liked than we think, especially the chairs!
  * Quality of talks: not adjusted for time, busy slides, two presenters for one talk, ...
* Topics for 2020:
  * Estimands (in the barchart, more estimand entries with comments are also found with lower frequencies).
  * Safety.
  * Involvement of HTA.

Please also have a look at the very last bullet point: "Comments (raw data)". These, I did not curate. Some key comments:

* Better prepare panel discussions.
* Share questions of Session 6 with panel before, and have them prepare better.
* Gender distribution (chairs, speakers).

  Relevant, up to date topics   

  Discussions about regulatory  
  view on statistical methods;  
    discussions about recent    
  developments in statistical   
      methods; the regular      
   participants like e.g. the   
 scientific committee. There is 
 a philosophical aspect in most 
 topics discussed. What are we  
 doing and how are we supposed  
 to do it - I really like this  

 Comments Stephen Evans and his 
    talk. Estimand sessions.    
      Contributed question      

  Safety and estimand session.  
   Right balance of details,    
     methods, and examples.

## Question: What did you dislike most about this workshop (raw data)?


--------------------------------
        Dislike the most        
--------------------------------
    The Uncomfortable chairs    

     Lack of attending list     

   Long sessions, they werre    
 great, but a few more smaller  
 breaks would have been better  
       for concentration        

 Session 5: presentations were  
    not really in the theme     

 Sessioon 5 (did not answer the 
             theme)             

     The fact we cannot ask     
      questions after each      
 presentation and have to wait  
      for panel discussion      

  Real world evideince session  
  mixing very different topics  

    Location, especially the    
 chaors (uncomfortable, easy to 
  move around), really hard to  
    sit on them through one     
            session             

  Salespitch on the floodlight  

        Dislike the room        

   Chairs were uncomfortable    

  Perhaps consider an earlier   
  finish on day 2 (maybe start  
       earlier on Monday)       

  Some presentations a little   
 rushed with insufficient time  
 to cover the topic, especially 
            etimands            

 Food - please avoid to impact  
 fruit from NZ in this time of  
       climate emergency        

   First day length was good,   
 second day was a litttle long  

  Some talks had very mediocre  
            quality             

 The real world evidence were a 
    bit theoritical and less    
            concrete            

  Unbalanced panel discussions  

     Presentations with two     
           presenters           

 Some presenters assume all in  
 the audience knew the disease  
     area. RWE had too much     
          space/focus           

    Some slides had too much    
             detail             

   Chairs were uncomfortable    

 Powerpoints too small to read, 
     some speakers were not     
         understandable         

          The chairs!           

          Coffee rows           

     Breaks were too short      

 Non-concrete talks talking on  
     high level/only about      
          definitions           

   RWE/RWID session was a bit   
           unfocused            

   Topics of talks were a bit   
   repetitive. More academic    
  research could be presented   

 Food, if I have to choose one  

    Sometimes drifting away,    
  towards vague non-technical   
            aspects             

 The front screen is not clear  

       Sometimes too many       
  presentations in one session  

  Quite narrow seating, but it  
           is alright           

       Nothing bad (some        
   presentations lasted a bit   
 continuously e.g. harmonising  
          safety data)          

     I felt lost in the RWD     
 sessions, did not see what we  
      wanted to conclude.

 this year already, but to keep 
      this for next year)       

   More about applied project   
         that used RWD          

    Experience with complex

             trials             

     Innovative design (not     
      adaptive design etc)      

     Maybe machine learning     

  Not sure, perhaps experience  
      with data monitoring      
  committees for safety (a few  
    for weeks) every single     
     observational slider.      
   Municipality with safety.    
     Continue on estimads.      

 More on safety, and RWD again  
       with better focus.

## Question: Comments (raw data)?


--------------------------------
      Additional comments       
--------------------------------
  Organise next conferences at  
  another place to mix further  
 statisticians (strong majority 
    of Basel - based company    
    attended the conference)    

 As a physiain, the course was  
   accessible and relevant so   
 perhaps consider the chemical  
   development professionals    

    Maybe a slightly shorter    
   second day - was lovely to   
     hear tje topics, quite     
 different to focus towards the 
   end since it's a long day    

    The ''safety analysis''     
       session was a bit        
   disappointing (except P+T    
           Friede's)            

    A workshop would be more    
     ''working'' (so maybe      
 discussing) in smaller groups  

  The chairs are to sit on all  
   day, but that's my biggest   
           complaint            

   Looking forward to the 5th   
  workshop! Please do not move  
  the workshop away from Basel  

  Hard seating / coffee supply  
 unsatisfactory day 1. Food and 
         drinks day 2.          

 Many talks too busy, too much  
             text.              

 Â a lot of time was allocated  
 to the panel discussions. With 
  this set up, I would propose  
     they are more actively     
  facilitated because now the   
  setting was that the loudest  
     person speaks the most     
 irrespective whether he stays  
   on the topic or not. This    
    requires of course quite    
 senior people as facilitators  
   but I am sure we can find    
 those. I felt the constructive 
  discussion part was missing   
    except in the estimands     
           discussion           

   the questions of session 6   
  should have been shared with  
  the panelists before hand so  
   that they could have come    
  prepared (the discussion on   
 the FDA blinding guidance was  
       quite frustrating)       

  also an updated agenda with   
 the questions would have been  
            helpful             

  more equal gender split. it   
 was just so evident this time. 
 from Roche internally we had 5 
 invited speakers and they were 
   all male!! also almost all   
  session chairs were male. I   
 know this is not an easy topic 
  but we have to do something   
  for it. Happy to talk about   
          this futher
